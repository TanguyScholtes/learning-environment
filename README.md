# Learning Environment

HTML &amp; CSS exercices from 1 to 8 from "La prairie", part of BeCode studentship.

You can find the list of exercices on the [LIE-Hamilton's BeCode promotion](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Hamilton-1.7/tree/master/01-La-prairie/01-html-css).

- In [markdown-to-html](https://github.com/TanguyScholtes/learning-environment/tree/master/markdown-to-html), you'll find the two first exercices : translate into HTML a Markdown introduction of ourselves (given there as README.md) and style it using CSS.  
- [html-basic](https://github.com/TanguyScholtes/learning-environment/tree/master/html-basic) is the 3rd exercice. It was to create a HTML one-page website for a charity, make quotations and external links in new tabs. As a bonus, we could include a Youtube video.

More to come soon. Stay tuned !
